\section{Quantum sensing setup}
\section{Photodetector design}\label{chap:td:tia_design}
As an integral part of the sensing setup, the photodetector needs a lot of attention. Good amplification is crucial to increasing the \gls{snr} of the quantum setup. Based on the design ideas presented in the functional design (see Chapter \ref{chap:photodetection_design}), the photodetection circuit can be drawn up.

\subsection{First iteration}
As previously mentioned, the first iteration of the PCB uses component values provided by the client. There is no specific information for the design process, aside from the fact that the original designer made the photodetector for input currents in the range of several nanoamperes. Such low inputs require high $R_1$ values, however increasing the resistor value results in more biasing current going to the amplifier and a more limited dynamic range \cite{black2021tia}. Furthermore, it is entirely possible that the original design did not thoroughly consider the bandwidth needed for different protocols, as \gls{cwodmr} setups do not require broad bandwidths \cite{acharya2025compact}. Biasing is another concern with this photodiode setup. The configuration shown in Figures \ref{fig:tia} and \ref{fig:td:tia_circuit_parasitic_v1} has the diode in the photovoltaic mode, which is suitable for low-frequency, low-light operation. In spite of this setup being suited to \gls{cwodmr}, pulsed protocols require micro to nanosecond precision




%\begin{equation}\label{eq:gbw}
%	f_{c} = (1 + \frac{C_d + C_{cm} + C_{df}}{C_1})f_{rc} \approx f_{rc}
%\end{equation}
%
%Even though $f_{rc}$ provides an approximation for the cutoff frequency, the parasitic capacitances in the system will cause it to be slightly bigger. Equation \ref{eq:gbw} shows how a more accurate cutoff frequency $f_c$ can be calculated by taking into account $C_d$ and $C_{cm}$ (differential and common-mode capacitance respectively). In this case, $f_c$ tells us the gain bandwidth or the frequency range in which DC gain is retained.

\subsection{Second iteration} \label{chap:td:calc:v2}
Due to time constraints, this iteration uses the same topology as the first one. That being said, it is still designed analytically, taking into account the general practices, but also considering more subtle factors that might hinder the performance of the system. This section uses the mathematical principles presented in \cite{margan2012transimpedance, sackinger2017analysis, horsthemke2025all} to optimize the design of the existing amplifier.

	\caption{Parasitic capacitances in a \gls{tia} circuit}
	\label{fig:td:tia_circuit_parasitic_v1}
\end{figure}

Introducing the real-world parasitic capacitances to the ideal \gls{tia} shown in Figure \ref{fig:tia} results in the circuit in Figure \ref{fig:td:tia_circuit_parasitic_v1}. The diode capacitance $C_d$, combined with the differential and common-mode capacitances of the amplifier ($C_{df}$ and $C_{cm}$), contributes a significant amount of capacitance to the circuit and can result in instability \cite{cherian2016you}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:ci}
	C_i = C_{d} + C_{df} + C_{cm}
\end{equation}

The combined input capacitance (Equation \ref{eq:td:ci}) is needed when solving the equation arising from \gls{kcl} at the inverting input of the amplifier. $Z_1$ (Equation \ref{eq:td:z1}), or the combined impedance of $R_1$ and $C_1$, is another prerequisite for deriving the transimpedance $Z_t$ using \gls{kcl}. Additionally, the open-loop gain $A_{ol}$ is needed for the derivation of the transimpedance. Equation \ref{eq:td:aol} shows the open-loop gain, expressed with the \gls{dc} open-loop gain $A_o$ and the open-loop cutoff frequency $\omega_o$, which is equivalent to $\frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}}$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:z1}
	Z_1(s) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + sC_1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:aol}
	A_{ol}(s) = A_o\frac{\omega_0}{s + \omega_0} = \frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}}
\end{equation}

Finally, the values in the \gls{kcl} equation (Equation \ref{eq:td:kcl}) can be substituted, from which $Z_t$ can be derived, as seen in Equation \ref{eq:td:zt}. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:kcl}
	i_f = \frac{v_i}{\frac{1}{sC_i}} + \frac{v_{in} - v_{out}}{Z_1(s)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:zt}
	\begin{aligned}
	&Z_t(s) = \frac{v_{out}}{i_f} = (R_1\frac{A_o}{1 + A_o})\frac{\frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}}{s^2 + s\frac{1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1}{(C_i + C_1)R_1} + \frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Before moving on to the pole analysis, the impact of the quality factor $Q$ on the system response should be considered (see Equation \ref{eq:td:f_c_q}). Two system poles present when $Q > 0,5$. For $Q = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3},$ the system has a Bessel response, which has the flattest group delay, however, if $Q = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, then the system has a Butterworth response, which means it has the flattest possible amplitude response. Although the group delay is not as important as the amplitude response, a Bessel response also results in smaller amount of overshoot and less jitter, which is why it is preferred. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:poles_general}
	H(s) = H_0\frac{(-s_1)(-s_2)}{(s - s_1)(s - s_2)} = H_0\frac{s_1s_2}{s^2 + s(-s_1 - s_2) + s_1s_2}
\end{equation}

Based on this consideration, the poles can be found using the general form of a second order transfer function, shown in Equation \ref{eq:td:poles_general}. The general form also makes it obvious that the \gls{dc} gain $H_0 \approx R_1$, assuming that $A_0$ is very big.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:poles}
	\begin{cases}
		-s_1 - s_2 = \frac{1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1}{(C_i + C_1)R_1} \\
		s_1s_2 = \frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Taking the general-equation poles and their counterparts from the $Z_t$ expression yields the system of equations shown in Equation \ref{eq:td:poles}. Solving for one pole first results in a quadratic equation with roots shown in Equation \ref{eq:td:pole_roots}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:pole_roots}
	s_{1, 2} = -\frac{1 + \omega_o(C_i(1+A_o)C_1)R_1}{2(C_i + C_1)R_1}\left(1 \pm j\sqrt{\frac{4\omega_o(1 + A_o)(C_i + C_1)R_1}{(1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1)^2} - 1}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:pole_roots_general}
	s_{1, 2} = -\frac{3}{2}(1 \pm j\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3})
\end{equation}

Achieving a critically-damped system, can be done by getting the roots of the general form of a Bessel filter (as seen in Equation \ref{eq:td:pole_roots_general}) and using the imaginary parts to get Equation \ref{eq:td:cap_solve}. This expression can be solved with the quadratic formula again, finally resulting in an answer for the compensating capacitor. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:cap_solve}
	\frac{4\omega_o(1 + A_o)(C_i + C_1)R_1}{(1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1)^2} = \frac{4}{3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:cap_roots}
	C_1 = \frac{-2\omega_oR_1C_i \pm \sqrt{12A_oC_iR_1\omega_o - 3}}{2\omega_oR_1(1 + A_o)}
\end{equation}

Although Equation \ref{eq:td:cap_roots} says there are two solutions for the capacitor, the term under the square root will always be much bigger than the rest of the numerator\footnote{Assuming real-world amplifier and diode specifications, and realistic transimpedance gain requirements}, effectively determining the sign of the roots. Simply put, this leaves only one root possible, as capacitors cannot have negative capacitance values.

To further characterize the system, the cutoff frequency $\omega_c$ and damping factor $Q$ can be calculated, because the system adheres to the general form, shown in Equation \ref{eq:td:f_c_q}. Substituting in the pole expressions from Equations \ref{eq:td:poles_general} and \ref{eq:td:poles}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:f_c_q}
	H(s) = H_o\frac{\omega_c^2}{s^2 + s\frac{\omega_c}{Q} + \omega_c^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\begin{cases}
		\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}}\\
		Q = \omega_c\frac{(C_i + C_1)R_1}{1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}


In the process of designing the \gls{tia} circuit, the noise should be considered. Figure \ref{fig:td:design:tia_noise} shows the thermal noise generated by the resistor (modeled as the current source $i_{nR}$) and the differential noise of the amplifier (modeled as the current source $i_{nA}$)\footnote{Other noise generators, like the gate shot noise, channel noise and induced gate noise can also be calculated, but because they largely depend on the underlying technology of the \gls{fet} op amp, they have not been investigated}.

	\label{fig:td:design:tia_noise}
\end{figure}

Calculating $i_{nR}$ can be done using the Johnson-Nyquist formula, as shown in Equation \ref{eq:td:noise_res}. Given the fact that the temperature $T$ and noise cutoff frequency $\delta{f}$ cannot be modified in this case, $R_1$ is  the only variable that can be used to lower the thermal noise current.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:noise_res}
	i_{nR} = \sqrt{\frac{4kT\Delta{f}}{R_1}}
\end{equation}

Combining the noise sources leads to Equation \ref{eq:td:noise_sources}, which also shows that the noise can be modeled as voltage sources.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:noise_sources}
		i_n(f) = \sqrt{i_{nR}^2 + i_{nA}^2} \Leftrightarrow
		v_n(f) = \sqrt{v_{nR}^2 + v_{nA}^2}
\end{equation}

In order to get a better understanding of the noise, its transfer function can be calculated in much the same way as the transimpedance (Equations \ref{eq:td:aol} - \ref{eq:td:zt}), leading to Equation \ref{eq:td:noise_tf}. While it might not be immediately obvious from the mathematical expression, the noise gain is \num{0} \unit{\decibel} at low frequencies, but it peaks when $f \approx f_c$. Chapter \ref{chap:td:v2} shows the noise frequency response obtained from the system equation.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:noise_tf}
	H_n(s) = \frac{v_o}{v_n} = \frac{A_o\omega_o(s + \frac{1}{(C_i + C_1)R_1})}{s^2 + s(\frac{1}{(C_i + C_1)R_1} + \omega_o(1 + A_o\frac{C_1}{C_i + C_1})) + \frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}}
\end{equation}

\section{Photodetection simulation}
Simulation is an important part of the designing process, as digital models of devices can be more detailed than the mathematical models presented thus far. Using different simulation programs, the real-world performance can be approximated and the math can be validated.


\subsection{First iteration}
Figure \ref{fig:photodetecog} shows the LTSpice design. $C_1$ and $R_2$, as well as the current source $I_1$ are used to simulate the behavior of a photodiode.

\end{figure}


Tina-TI was used to simulate and visualize the DC gain and frequency response of the system, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:tina2probes}. The signals $V_{ot}$ and $V_{out}$ correspond to the output of the transimpedance and non-inverting amplification stage respectively. The AC plot (Figure \ref{fig:tinaac2probes}) shows the cutoff, at \num{10,77} \unit{\kilo \hertz}, and the gain inside the gain bandwidth, which is \num{160,82} \unit{\decibel}. The DC plot (Figure \ref{fig:tinadc2probes}) shows the voltage with respect to the current and demonstrates the linearity of the system in the range of \numrange{0}{46,31} \unit{\nano \ampere}. After $V_{out}$ reaches \num{5} \unit{V}, the output remains fixed, because it cannot exceed the voltage provided to the amplifier.

\subsection{Second iteration}\label{chap:td:v2}
A MATLAB script was written to calculate the component values based on the calculations in Chapter \ref{chap:td:calc:v2}. 


\section{Photodetection implementation}
Creating the physical \gls{pcb} is a more straightforward process than the design and simulation, but it still needs to be discussed. 

\subsection{First iteration}
Figure \ref{fig:photodetecogpcb} shows the back side of the PCB. It hosts all components, except for the photodiode, which sits unobstructed on the front side. Requirements for the physical dimensions were also set by the client. The PCB needs to fit the Thorlabs mount standard, since the rest of the setup also uses it.
