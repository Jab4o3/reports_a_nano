\section{Current driver}\label{chap:td:curr_driv}
As was previously discussed, the existing driver does not need any hardware changes, but there are some notable details that play a role when configuring the driver.
 



\subsection{Pulsing sequences}
Previously, $T_1$ and \gls{podmr} were mentioned when discussing pulsed protocols. However, due to the high-frequency instability of the Analog Discovery signals, only sequences for $T_1$ measurements were made. Chapter \ref{chap:fd:t1} presented an overview of the $T_1$ pulsing scheme. 

The lock-in amplifier reference signal can easily be generated by the Waveforms software. This is not the case for the laser driver signal. Waveforms supports custom sequence programming, however the system for writing these sequences only allows for pulses, which have a duration $\tau_{las}$ for which $\tau_{las} \geq \frac{T_{seq}}{100}$ holds true\footnote{$T_{seq}$ is the period of the whole sequence}. It should also be noted that using the built-in pulse generation functionalities only allow for pulses that fit the formula $\tau_{las} = x\frac{T_{seq}}{100}$, where $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and $x \leq 100$. These restrictions make it impossible for pulsing sequences to be designed in Waveforms. Thankfully, the software can read files, which makes it possible to customize a sequence more.

	\caption{Sequence buffer}
	\label{fig:td:driver:working_principle}
\end{figure}

But before delving into implementation details, the working of pulse generation in Waveforms needs to be discussed. An example of a filled Waveforms buffer, is shown Figure \ref{fig:td:driver:working_principle}. A \gls{ttl} signal can be generated using the values from it by setting the period $T_{seq}$ of the sequence and the peak voltage $V_{max}$. Those two values are necessary, because the buffer contains normalized values. In the example, each element has a value of either 0 or 1, which translate to 0 or $V_{max}$ when entered into the function generator. Furthermore, each pulse has a value of $\tau_{las} = \frac{T_{seq}}{5}$.

A MATLAB script (see Figure \ref{code:t1_pulse} for full script) was written to generate buffer values based on the pulse duration $\tau_{las}$, the scaling factor $\gamma = \frac{T_{seq}}{\tau_{las}}$ and the normalized dark time $t_d = \frac{\tau_{d}}{\tau_{las}0}$. Figure \ref{fig:fd:waveformssequence} shows a $T_1$ sequence where $\tau_{las}$ = 20 \unit{\micro\second}, $T_{seq}$ = 30 \unit{\milli\second} and $\tau_{d}$ = 200 \unit{\micro\second} (consequently $\gamma$ = 1500 and $t_d$ = 10).

\section{Photodetector design}\label{chap:td:tia_design}
As an integral part of the sensing setup, the photodetector needs a lot of attention. Good amplification is crucial to increasing the \gls{snr} of the quantum setup, however the materials used need to be accessible and cheap. Based on these considerations and the design ideas presented in the functional design (see Chapter \ref{chap:photodetection_design}), the photodetection circuit can be drawn up. The first three versions presented in this section of the report address the basic requirements of a \gls{cwodmr} detector, which can have a bandwidth as low as 18 \unit{\hertz} \cite{acharya2025compact}. In contrast, the fourth iteration of the photodetector design focuses mostly on providing an increase in bandwidth, which is necessary for pulsed protocols.

\subsection{First iteration}
As previously mentioned, the first iteration of the PCB uses component values provided by the client. There is no specific information for the design process, aside from the fact that the original designer made the photodetector for input currents in the range of several nanoamperes. Such low inputs require high $R_1$ values, however increasing the resistor value results in more biasing current going to the amplifier and a more limited dynamic range \cite{black2021tia}. Furthermore, it is entirely possible that the original design did not thoroughly consider the bandwidth needed for different protocols, as \gls{cwodmr} setups do not require broad bandwidths \cite{acharya2025compact}. Biasing is another concern with this photodiode setup. The configuration shown in Figures \ref{fig:tia} and \ref{fig:td:tia_circuit_parasitic_v1} has the diode in the photovoltaic mode, which is suitable for low-frequency, low-light operation. In spite of this setup being suited to \gls{cwodmr}, pulsed protocols require micro to nanosecond precision




%\begin{equation}\label{eq:gbw}
%	f_{c} = (1 + \frac{C_d + C_{cm} + C_{df}}{C_1})f_{rc} \approx f_{rc}
%\end{equation}
%
%Even though $f_{rc}$ provides an approximation for the cutoff frequency, the parasitic capacitances in the system will cause it to be slightly bigger. Equation \eqref{eq:gbw} shows how a more accurate cutoff frequency $f_c$ can be calculated by taking into account $C_d$ and $C_{cm}$ (differential and common-mode capacitance respectively). In this case, $f_c$ tells us the gain bandwidth or the frequency range in which DC gain is retained.

\subsection{Second iteration} \label{chap:td:calc:v2}
Due to time constraints, this iteration uses the same topology as the first one. That being said, it is still designed analytically, taking into account the general practices, but also considering more subtle factors that might hinder the performance of the system. This section uses the mathematical principles presented in \cite{margan2012transimpedance, sackinger2017analysis, horsthemke2025all} to optimize the design of the existing amplifier.

	\caption{Parasitic capacitances in a \gls{tia} circuit}
	\label{fig:td:tia_circuit_parasitic_v1}
\end{figure}

Introducing the real-world parasitic capacitances to the ideal \gls{tia} shown in Figure \ref{fig:tia} results in the circuit in Figure \ref{fig:td:tia_circuit_parasitic_v1}. The diode capacitance $C_d$, combined with the differential and common-mode capacitances of the amplifier ($C_{df}$ and $C_{cm}$), contributes a significant amount of capacitance to the circuit and can result in instability \cite{cherian2016you}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:ci}
	C_i = C_{d} + C_{df} + C_{cm}
\end{equation}

The combined input capacitance (Equation \eqref{eq:td:ci}) is needed when solving the equation arising from \gls{kcl} at the inverting input of the amplifier. $Z_1$ (Equation \eqref{eq:td:z1}), or the combined impedance of $R_1$ and $C_1$, is another prerequisite for deriving the transimpedance $Z_t$ using \gls{kcl}. Additionally, the open-loop gain $A_{ol}$ is needed for the derivation of the transimpedance. Equation \eqref{eq:td:aol} shows the open-loop gain, expressed with the \gls{dc} open-loop gain $A_o$ and the open-loop cutoff frequency $\omega_o$, which is equivalent to $\frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}}$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:z1}
	Z_1(s) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + sC_1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:aol}
	A_{ol}(s) = A_o\frac{\omega_0}{s + \omega_0} = \frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}}
\end{equation}

Finally, the values in the \gls{kcl} equation (Equation \eqref{eq:td:kcl}) can be substituted, from which $Z_t$ can be derived, as seen in Equation \eqref{eq:td:zt}. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:kcl}
	i_f = \frac{v_i}{\frac{1}{sC_i}} + \frac{v_{in} - v_{out}}{Z_1(s)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:zt}
	\begin{aligned}
	&Z_t(s) = \frac{v_{out}}{i_f} = (R_1\frac{A_o}{1 + A_o})\frac{\frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}}{s^2 + s\frac{1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1}{(C_i + C_1)R_1} + \frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Before moving on to the pole analysis, the impact of the quality factor $Q$ on the system response should be considered (see Equation \eqref{eq:td:f_c_q}). Two system poles present when $Q > 0,5$. For $Q = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3},$ the system has a Bessel response, which has the flattest group delay, however, if $Q = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, then the system has a Butterworth response, which means it has the flattest possible amplitude response. Although the group delay is not as important as the amplitude response, a Bessel response also results in smaller amount of overshoot and less jitter, which is why it is preferred. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:poles_general}
	H(s) = H_0\frac{(-s_1)(-s_2)}{(s - s_1)(s - s_2)} = H_0\frac{s_1s_2}{s^2 + s(-s_1 - s_2) + s_1s_2}
\end{equation}

Based on this consideration, the poles can be found using the general form of a second order transfer function, shown in Equation \eqref{eq:td:poles_general}. The general form also makes it obvious that the \gls{dc} gain $H_0 \approx R_1$, assuming that $A_0$ is very big.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:poles}
	\begin{cases}
		-s_1 - s_2 = \frac{1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1}{(C_i + C_1)R_1} \\
		s_1s_2 = \frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Taking the general-equation poles and their counterparts from the $Z_t$ expression yields the system of equations shown in Equation \eqref{eq:td:poles}. Solving it results in a quadratic equation with roots shown in Equation \eqref{eq:td:pole_roots}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:pole_roots}
	s_{1, 2} = -\frac{1 + \omega_o(C_i(1+A_o)C_1)R_1}{2(C_i + C_1)R_1}\left(1 \pm j\sqrt{\frac{4\omega_o(1 + A_o)(C_i + C_1)R_1}{(1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1)^2} - 1}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:pole_roots_general}
	s_{1, 2} = -\frac{3}{2}(1 \pm j\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3})
\end{equation}

Achieving a critically-damped system, can be done by getting the roots of the general form of a Bessel filter (as seen in Equation \eqref{eq:td:pole_roots_general}) and using the imaginary parts to get Equation \eqref{eq:td:cap_solve}. This expression can be solved with the quadratic formula again, finally resulting in an answer for the compensating capacitor. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:cap_solve}
	\frac{4\omega_o(1 + A_o)(C_i + C_1)R_1}{(1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1)^2} = \frac{4}{3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:cap_roots}
	C_1 = \frac{-2\omega_oR_1C_i \pm \sqrt{12A_oC_iR_1\omega_o - 3}}{2\omega_oR_1(1 + A_o)}
\end{equation}

Although Equation \eqref{eq:td:cap_roots} says there are two solutions for the capacitor, the term under the square root will always be much bigger than the rest of the numerator\footnote{Assuming real-world amplifier and diode specifications, and realistic transimpedance gain requirements}, effectively determining the sign of the roots. Simply put, this leaves only one root possible, as capacitors cannot have negative capacitance values.

To further characterize the system, the cutoff frequency $\omega_c$ and damping factor $Q$ can be calculated, because the system adheres to the general form, shown in Equation \eqref{eq:td:f_c_q}. Substituting in the pole expressions from Equations \eqref{eq:td:poles_general} and \eqref{eq:td:poles}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:f_c_q}
	H(s) = H_o\frac{\omega_c^2}{s^2 + s\frac{\omega_c}{Q} + \omega_c^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\begin{cases}
		\omega_c = \sqrt{\frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}}\\
		Q = \omega_c\frac{(C_i + C_1)R_1}{1 + \omega_o(C_i + (1 + A_o)C_1)R_1}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}


In the process of designing the \gls{tia} circuit, the noise should be considered. Figure \ref{fig:td:design:tia_noise} shows the thermal noise generated by the resistor (modeled as the current source $i_{nR}$) and the differential noise of the amplifier (modeled as the current source $i_{nA}$)\footnote{Other noise generators, like the gate shot noise, channel noise and induced gate noise can also be calculated, but because they largely depend on the underlying technology of the \gls{fet} op amp, they have not been investigated}.

	\caption{Noise sources in a \gls{tia} circuit}
	\label{fig:td:design:tia_noise}
\end{figure}

Calculating $i_{nR}$ can be done using the Johnson-Nyquist formula, as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:td:noise_res}. Given the fact that the temperature $T$ and noise cutoff frequency $\delta{f}$ cannot be modified in this case, $R_1$ is  the only variable that can be used to lower the thermal noise current.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:noise_res}
	i_{nR} = \sqrt{\frac{4kT\Delta{f}}{R_1}}
\end{equation}

Combining the noise sources leads to Equation \eqref{eq:td:noise_sources}, which also shows that the noise can be modeled as voltage sources.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:noise_sources}
		i_n(f) = \sqrt{i_{nR}^2 + i_{nA}^2} \Leftrightarrow
		v_n(f) = \sqrt{v_{nR}^2 + v_{nA}^2}
\end{equation}

In order to get a better understanding of the noise, its transfer function can be calculated in much the same way as the transimpedance (Equations \ref{eq:td:aol} - \ref{eq:td:zt}), leading to Equation \eqref{eq:td:noise_tf}. While it might not be immediately obvious from the mathematical expression, the noise gain is \num{0} \unit{\decibel} at low frequencies, but it peaks when $f \approx f_c$. Chapter \ref{chap:td:v2} shows the noise frequency response obtained from the system equation.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:noise_tf}
	H_n(s) = \frac{v_o}{v_n} = \frac{A_o\omega_o(s + \frac{1}{(C_i + C_1)R_1})}{s^2 + s(\frac{1}{(C_i + C_1)R_1} + \omega_o(1 + A_o\frac{C_1}{C_i + C_1})) + \frac{\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{(C_i + C_1)R_1}}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Third iteration}
While the second version of the photodetector focuses on improving the TIA performance, the third iteration is more about adapting the design for the setup. The most important considerations for the setup are function and size. Form factor constraints arise from the fact that the setup needs to be as small and adhere to the Thorlabs mounting standard. Photodetection also needs to not require many external connections or ideally be standalone. This is feasible for the data flow, as the photodetection PCB only needs light and an output to work. Unlike the data connections, version two of the design has a suboptimal power delivery system, as it uses three pins for the supply of power. 

Three alternatives methods for power delivery were considered, all of which only need power and ground to work. The first one is an onboard split-rail power supply, which would take the power input and would output a fixed positive and negative voltage. Figure \ref{fig:td:des:adafruitsplitrailboost} shows an example of what a split-rail supply implementation might look like. There are also external option \cite{clark2025boost}, which might be necessary in the future, if the setup size needs to be reduced even more.

	\label{fig:td:des:adafruitsplitrailboost}
\end{figure}


A simpler solution would be to use a virtual ground driver \gls{ic}, as it would provide a reference point at half of the supply voltage. Such a supply would also be good for decreasing the size, as the \gls{pcb} needs minimal additions to satisfy the power needs of the photodetector. Additionally, a virtual ground circuit, which behaves similarly, can be made using two voltage regulators. The example in Figure \ref{fig:td:des:virtground} is a slightly more stable implementation

	\label{fig:td:des:virtground}
\end{figure}


Another possibility is to implement a charge pump, which inverts the input voltage. This setup would only need half of the input voltage required for the virtual ground solution, effectively enabling it to be powered via a standard \gls{usb} connector.

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Comparison of power supply options}
	\label{tab:power_supply}
\end{table}

The specifications of the different power supply solutions are shown in Table \ref{tab:power_supply}, from which can be deduced that there is a correlation between complexity and performance. The split-rail power supply, as the most complex solution, has the biggest current output range and lowest current consumption, but as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:td:des:adafruitsplitrailboost}, there are a number of other components that are required for proper implementation. In contrast, the virtual ground supply concept has relatively poor specifications compared to the other options, but it is the only solution that does not employ a switching mechanism, thus avoiding any possible noise. Lastly, the charge pump inverter offers reasonable performance, while not needing as many extra components as the split-rail supply. Furthermore, it addresses the stability concerns that might arise when using a virtual ground \gls{ic}. 

Ultimately, the charge pump is the most fit for this project, because it is relatively simple, while also offering excellent stability. The decision was reached only after taking into account the power calculations from Chapter \ref{chap:fd:power_req}, according to which all devices can handle the power requirements of the circuit. Another important factor when making the decision was the efficiency of the switching solutions. Based on slight fluctuations in the amount of current drawn, the charge pump can have as much as twice the efficiency of the split-rail power supply \cite{instruments2015tps6040x, ti2015tps65133}, due to its high efficiency at low currents.

\subsection{Fourth iteration}\label{chap:td:v4_design}
Although the previous iterations provided a cheap and reliable photodetector for \gls{cwodmr}, the narrow bandwidth prevents them from measuring pulsed protocols. This iteration is specifically designed for $T_1$ measurements.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{matlab/bode_v4_v3_10Mohm_1Mohm}
	\caption{Bandwidth comparison of the third iteration of the \gls{tia} (based on AD795) and one based on an ADA4637 op-amp with a 10 \unit{\mega\ohm} and a 1 \unit{\mega\ohm} $R_1$}
	\label{fig:td:bodev410mohm1mohm}
\end{figure}

The simplest way to increase the bandwidth of the \gls{tia} is to decrease its transimpedance gain. Additionally, an op-amp with a higher \gls{gbp} will also contribute to a substantial increase in gain. Figure \ref{fig:td:bodev410mohm1mohm} shows the ideal version of the \gls{tia}, used in the second and third iteration of the system (in blue). It uses an AD795 amplifier, which has a 1,6 \unit{\mega\hertz} \gls{gbp}. The resulting cutoff frequency is \num{19,69} \unit{\kilo\hertz}. Only swapping the AD795 for an ADA4637, which has a 79 \unit{\mega\hertz} \gls{gbp}, results in the system response in orange. Its cutoff frequency is \num{138,87} \unit{\kilo\hertz}. Both lines show a system with the same transimpedance gain and consequently $R_1$ value. On the other hand, the yellow line shows the increase in bandwidth with a 10 times smaller gain\footnote{The plot shows normalized gain of each system, which is why the first two systems (140 \unit{\decibel}) have the same gain as the last system (120 \unit{\decibel})}. The ADA4637 system with 1 \unit{\mega\ohm} $R_1$ has a cutoff frequency of \num{437,32} \unit{\kilo\hertz}.


While these changes contribute to an improved bandwidth, they are limited by the compensation capacitor $C_1$. Its purpose is to counteract the negative effects of the diode capacitance $C_d$ and stabilize the frequency response of the system. In doing so, however, it also reduces the bandwidth of the system. Decreasing the capacitance of $C_1$ outright can lead to unwanted resonance, but it is possible to stabilize $C_d$ and consequently reduce the value of $C_1$ by using bootstrapping. The design discussed in this section is based on \cite{sackinger2017analysis, hoyle1998bootstrapping, hoyle1999shunt, idrus2006performance}.

	\caption{Shunt bootstrap \gls{tia} circuit}
	\label{fig:td:tia_bootstrap}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:td:tia_bootstrap} shows the bootstrapped \gls{tia}. The same analysis as in Chapter \ref{chap:td:calc:v2} can be applied to the circuit, which leads to the transimpedance $Z_t$ in Equation \eqref{eq:td:v4:trans}. The additional op-amp buffer creates an extra pole and zero. In the expression, $C_i$ is the sum of the common-mode and differential capacitance of the amplifier, $C_d$ is the photodiode capacitance, $A_o$ is the intrinsic open-loop gain of the amplifier, $\omega_o$ is the open-loop cutoff frequency and all other parameters correspond to the ones in Figure \ref{fig:td:tia_bootstrap}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:v4:trans}
	Z_t(s) = \frac{v_{out}}{i_f} = \frac{R_1}{s^2\frac{\left(C_i + C_1 + C_d\right)R_1}{\omega_oA_o} + s\left(\frac{\left(C_i + C_1 + C_d\right)R_1}{A_o} + C_1R_1 + \frac{1}{\omega_oA_o}\right) - \frac{s\left(s + \omega_o\right)C_dR_1}{s + \omega_o(1 + A_o)} + \frac{A_o + 1}{A_o}}
\end{equation}

Determining the ideal $C_1$ by solving the characteristic equation of the system analytically is even harder than in the previous designs, which is why the system equation was solved by trial and error, and with the use of MATLAB to plot the system response with different capacitor values. The solution is discussed in more detail in Chapter \ref{chap:td:v4_sim}.

While the improvements to the \gls{tia} are crucial for broadening its bandwidth, the changes also affect the post-amplification stage. It needs to compensate for the gain reduction that was previously discussed. Despite, a simple gain increase being a viable solution, this will also reduce the bandwidth. Similarly to the \gls{tia}, the non-inverting amplifier is also affected by the gain-bandwidth relationship, as dictated by the \gls{gbp}, shown in Equation \eqref{eq:td:v4:gbp+gain}, where $A_v$ is the gain of the stage.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:v4:gbp+gain}
	f_c = \frac{GBP}{A_v}
\end{equation}

An alternative to increasing the gain is to add a second non-inverting stage with the same gain. By doing this, the bandwidth does not decrease as a result of the gain-bandwidth relationship, but the cutoff frequency $f_{c\alpha}$ of single-stage non-inverting amplifier even increases as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:td:v4:nia_cascading}\footnote{The formula assumes the non-inverting stages have the same parameters and use the same components as in the actual design} \cite{ti2020cascading}. In the equation, $A_{df}$ is the bandwidth increase due to the single-stage gain reduction.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:v4:nia_cascading}
	f_c \approx A_{df}\left(\frac{1}{f_{c\alpha}^2} + \frac{1}{f_{c\alpha}^2}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{A_{df}}{\sqrt{2}}f_{c\alpha}
\end{equation}

%\begin{equation}\label{eq:td:v4:trans_re}
%	\begin{split}
%	Z_t(s) = \frac{sR_1 + R_1\omega_o(1 + A_o)}{s ^3(\frac{(C_i + C_1 + C_d)R_1}{A_o}) + s^2(\frac{2 + A_o}{A_o}(C_i + C_1 + C_d)R_1 + (C_1 - C_d)R_1 + \frac{1}{\omega_oA_o})} + \\

%\end{equation}

Finally, Figure \ref{fig:td:v4schematic} shows the schematic of the system after all the modifications.

\section{Photodetection simulation}
Simulation is an important part of the designing process, as digital models of devices can be more detailed than the mathematical models presented thus far. Using different simulation programs, the real-world performance can be approximated and the math can be validated.


\subsection{First iteration}
\begin{figure} [!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/TIA_TINA_SIM_1P6}
	\caption{First iteration of the photodetector circuit}
	\label{fig:photodetecog}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:photodetecog} shows the schematic of the circuit. The capacitor $C_4$, as well as the current source $I_1$ are used to simulate the behavior of a photodiode.

Tina-TI was used to simulate and visualize the DC gain and frequency response of the system, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:tina2probes}. The signals $V_{ot}$ and $V_{out}$ correspond to the output of the transimpedance and non-inverting amplification stage respectively. The AC plot (Figure \ref{fig:tinaac2probes}) shows the cutoff, at \num{10,77} \unit{\kilo \hertz}, and the gain inside the gain bandwidth, which is \num{160,82} \unit{\decibel}. The DC plot (Figure \ref{fig:tinadc2probes}) shows the voltage with respect to the current and demonstrates the linearity of the system in the range of \numrange{0}{46,31} \unit{\nano \ampere}. After $V_{out}$ reaches \num{5} \unit{V}, the output remains fixed, because it cannot exceed the voltage provided to the amplifier.

	\caption{Simulation of the first iteration of the photodetector}
	\label{fig:tina2probes}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Second iteration}\label{chap:td:v2}

A MATLAB script was written to calculate the component values based on the calculations in Chapter \ref{chap:td:calc:v2}. 

MATLAB calculates the component values with high precision and sourcing components with the exact values is not feasible, which is why components with standard values will be used in the setup. Simulations with standardized components were also done to compare the mathematically-ideal setup to the one in practice. 

\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\glsfmtshort{tia} version & v2 (Ideal) & v2 (Real.)	    & v1 		\\
		\hline
		$C_1$ (\unit{\pico \farad}) & \num{0,96904} & \num{1}	    & \num{1,6} 		\\
		\hline
		$f_c$ (\unit{\kilo \hertz}) & \num{22,0768} & \num{21,167}  &  \num{11,2422}	\\
		\hline
		
		$Q$  					    & \num{0,57735} & \num{0,55996} &  \num{0,35487}   \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\gls{tia} parameters with a \num{10} \unit{\mega \ohm} feedback resistor $R_1$}
	\label{tab:td:params}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:td:params} contains the MATLAB calculation results and shows the values of $f_c$ and $Q$ when only $C_1$ changes. $R_1$ is kept the same, as it is equivalent the \gls{dc} transimpedance $Z_{tDC}$\footnote{For realistic op-amps, $\frac{A_o}{A_o + 1} \to 1$, which means $Z_{tDC} \equiv R_1$ can be assumed to simplify explanations}. Importantly, the results show that the previous iteration had an overdamped response. Although the quality factor with realistic component values is also lower than the ideal $Q = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, the system sill behaves approximately like a Bessel filter.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{matlab/bode_v1_v2_comparison}
	\caption{Bode plot of the system with different capacitors}
	\label{fig:td:bodev1v2comparison}
\end{figure}

Using these values, the system model was calculated and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:td:bodev1v2comparison}. Certain differences can be seen between the two iterations. Most notably, the cutoff frequency $f_c$ of the first iteration is somewhat smaller than that of the second iteration. Furthermore, it can be observed that both the ideal and realistic versions of the system behave similarly. 


\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[1a]{.49\linewidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/tina_AC_2probes_1p}

		\label{fig:tinadc2probes1p}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Simulation of the second iteration of the photodetector}
	\label{fig:tina2probes1p}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:tina2probes1p} confirms the calculations, with some slight differences that can be attributed to the \gls{spice} models. As predicted, the frequency response of the circuit shows an increased cutoff frequency of \num{19,69} \unit{\kilo\hertz}, \num{8,92} \unit{\kilo\hertz} more than the previous iteration. Up to the cutoff frequency, the transimpedance gain is \num{160,83} \unit{\decibel}, which is almost the same as the former gain of \num{160,82} \unit{\decibel}. Furthermore, Figure \ref{fig:tinadc2probes1p} shows that, similarly to the first iteration, the system displays linearity in the range of \numrange{0}{45,86} \unit{\nano \ampere}. This is a reduction of \num{450} \unit{\pico\ampere} compared to the previous version and also \num{4,14} \unit{\nano \ampere} less than the ideal upper limit of the linear region.



\subsection{Third iteration}
Before deciding on a power supply system, the power requirements needed to be compared to the specifications listed in Table \ref{tab:power_supply}. A MATLAB script, which can be found in Appendix \ref{chap:appendix:code}, was written and used to calculate that, given a \textpm 5 \unit{\volt} supply, the system requires \num{2,3021} \unit{\milli\ampere} of current.  All solutions can provide that amount of current with reasonable overhead, which is why the choice was based on size, complexity and stability.

\subsection{Fourth iteration}\label{chap:td:v4_sim}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{matlab/bode_bootstrap_vs_nostrap}
	\caption{Comparison of a bootstrapped \gls{tia} and a normal \gls{tia} with the same transimpedance gain}
	\label{fig:td:bodebootstrapvsnostrap}
\end{figure}

As previously discussed, the value of the capacitor could not be determined analytically, however an approximate value was calculated using MATLAB simulations. Figure \ref{fig:td:bodebootstrapvsnostrap} shows that the bootstrapped system demonstrates a significantly increased bandwidth.


According to Table \ref{tab:td:v4_params}, the bootstrapped amplifier still has a quality factor $Q$ close to the ideal \num{0,57735}, which is even better than the previous iterations of the system. Furthermore, the capacitor value is standard, meaning that the value can be used in the physical system without further approximations.

\begin{table}[!ht]

	\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|}

	\caption{Comparison of \gls{tia} parameters of the fourth and second/third iteration of the system}

\end{table}



\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[1a]{.7\linewidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/LTSpice_sim_v4_1stage}

	\caption{Simulation of the second iteration of the photodetector}
	\label{fig:td:v4_nia}
\end{figure}

Additionally, the post-amplification part of the system was simulated with and without the cascaded stages. Shown in Figure \ref{fig:td:v4_nia}, the results demonstrate a significant increase in bandwidth. The plot of the bootstrapped \gls{tia} discussed in the design section (Chapter \ref{chap:td:v4_design}) with a single 40 \unit{\decibel} non-inverting stage shows a flat response with a cutoff frequency of approximately 229 \unit{\kilo\hertz}. This is significantly lower than 721 \unit{\kilo\hertz}, which is the bandwidth of the \gls{tia} without any post-amplification (Figure \ref{fig:td:v4_nia:none}). Figure \ref{fig:td:v4_nia:cascaded} shows the increased bandwidth of \num{1,517} \unit{\mega\hertz} when two stages are used instead of one. In spite of the significantly bigger cutoff frequency, the response is not maximally flat, which means the linearity at high frequencies is subpar.

\section{Photodetection implementation}
Creating the physical \gls{pcb} is a more straightforward process than the design and simulation, but it still needs to be discussed. 

\subsection{First iteration}
Figure \ref{fig:photodetecogpcb} shows the back side of the PCB. It hosts all components, except for the photodiode, which sits unobstructed on the front side. Requirements for the physical dimensions were also set by the client. The PCB needs to fit the Thorlabs mount standard, since the rest of the setup also uses it.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Second iteration}
Due to the fact that the topology of the first iteration was kept, the \gls{pcb} does not need any modifications in order to work with the circuit parameters. However, after a discussion with the client, a ground plane was added. Usually such an addition would be needed in high-speed and/or high-power use cases, but the circuit only deals with low-speed, very-low-power signals. The reason for the ground plane in the updated design is broader quantum protocol support. While \gls{cwodmr} operates at low frequencies, future expansion of the sensing setup might require support for different high-speed pulsing sequences. In that case, the component values can be modified again, without the need for making a new board. Figure \ref{fig:td:imp:photodetecv2gppcb2} shows the new board design. The updated board also has better routing than the previous version, which was done to optimize the noise performance.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Third iteration}
The third version of the board has more components, which combined with the fixed board dimensions, made it more difficult to do the placing and routing. Additionally, the clearance of the power and ground nets was increased. Figure \ref{fig:td:imp:photodetecv3} shows the \gls{ecad} view of the third iteration of the photodetector.
